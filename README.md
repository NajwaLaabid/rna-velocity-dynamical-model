# Dynamical modeling of RNA velocity

This work explores the velocity models proposed in [Volker et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0591-3), namely: steady-state model, dynamical model, and stochastic models.

Details on these methods is available in `report.pdf`. Code and more commentary in the README.md are coming up soon.
